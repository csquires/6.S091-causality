### Description

In this course, we will cover introductory material from three active research areas related to 
causality and machine learning. In the first third of the course, we will discuss the fundamentals 
of policy evaluation, where a known causal structure is used to estimate causal quantities such as 
(conditional) average treatment effects. In this section, we will cover algorithms for identification 
of causal estimands, as well the principles behind state-of-the-art estimation methods based on 
double/de-biased machine learning. In the second third of the course, we will consider causal 
structure learning, i.e., the estimation of an unknown causal structure from data. We will cover 
classical algorithms such as the PC algorithm, as well as newer methods which incorporate interventional 
data and allow for unobserved confounding. We will also cover experimental design techniques for causal 
structure learning. In the final third of the course, we will discuss the emerging field of causal 
representation learning, highlighting recent papers which connect machine learning with more traditional 
causal principles.
